<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Liyi Yao 姚理议, a currently attending M.S. student at Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California (USC). I graduated from Sichuan University (SCU), Chengdu, China, and received my B.S. degree in Computer Science. I'm now working as a research assistant in [DeepUSC](https://deep.usc.edu/). 

My research focuses on deep learning, including object detection, anomaly detection, language modeling, etc. And I'm also interested in robotics and reinforcement learning as well. I'm now searching for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2024. More information about me is in my [CV](./docs/cv.pdf)
