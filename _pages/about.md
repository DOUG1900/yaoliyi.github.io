I'm Liyi Yao ÂßöÁêÜËÆÆ, a currently attending M.S. student at Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California (USC). I graduated from Sichuan University (SCU), Chengdu, China, and received my B.S. degree in Computer Science. My previous research and development experience focus on deep learning, including object detection, anomaly detection, language modeling, etc. I'm now looking for a job as a machine learning engineer. More information about me can be found in my [CV](./assets/cv.pdf)

[Dual-Student Knowledge Distillation Networks for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00448)

**Liyi Yao**, Shaobing Gao, arXiv:2402.00448, 2024

- Propose an anomaly detection model based on student-teacher networks for industrial inspection.
- Set up two student networks with inverted structure, i.e. dual-student, to enhance the diversity of the representation of anomalous data.
- Leverage feature embeddings and multi-scale feature matching to explore high-dimension semantic information.
- Our proposed model performs well on three benchmark datasets.
